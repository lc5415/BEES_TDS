# BEES_TDS
## Project description & aims
### Data set (N~500,000) 
 - UK Biobank
 - Genetic and biochemistry data, lifestyle and socio-economic factors
 - Outcomes of interest: __cardiovascular disease__
 
### Suggested methodological approaches
 - Integrating the genetic information in a Polygenic Risk Score
 - Computing the Biological Health Score (allostatic load) from biochemistry data
 - Derive univariate/multivariate disease prediction models using (sets of) biomarkers 
 - Evaluate and compare prediction performance of the models
 - Assess their complementarity to known risk-factors
 
### Supervisors
Verena Zuber, Marc Chadeau-Hyam, Barbara Bodinier, Matt Whitaker
